# Overview
As a simple assignment for my [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course (CSE 486)](https://www.miamioh.edu/cec/academics/departments/cse/academics/course-descriptions/cse-486-586/index.html) at Miami University, we were tasked with a simple spam classifier with Bayes' theorem.

# Local Setup
